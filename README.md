1. [**ACL (Access Control List)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)

7. **[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control)**: syntax sugar like ``resource.Owner`` can be used to get the attribute for a resource.
8. **Graphql** support .
9. **Deny-override**: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
